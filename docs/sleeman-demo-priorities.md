# Brian Cappellaro: Strategic Profile for AI Data Platform Engagement

Brian Cappellaro leads a **36-person IT department** at Canada's third-largest brewery, overseeing both technology operations and the Project Management Office. His dual mandate—keeping systems running while driving strategic projects—creates a classic IT leadership dilemma: demonstrating innovation to his Japanese parent company while managing an Oracle-centric legacy environment with data trapped in silos across four breweries. A Text-to-SQL AI platform directly addresses his core challenge of democratizing data access without requiring massive infrastructure investments.

## Career trajectory reveals a pragmatic technology leader

Brian's 30+ year career follows a classic IT management progression. He graduated from **Western University** (1987-1991), then advanced through systems management at CapeTown Computing and IT management at Associated Brands LP before joining Sleeman. His 2013 **Business Process Management certificate from University of San Francisco** signals commitment to operational excellence over pure technology for technology's sake. He renewed his **PMP certification in early 2025**, demonstrating active investment in project management credentials—essential for his PMO oversight role.

A former colleague's recommendation captures his leadership style: *"Brian has the ability to change your thinking on a given subject... He always brought value to the table and did so with a smile."* This suggests someone who influences through persuasion rather than authority, preferring consensus-building to mandate. His LinkedIn shows **500+ connections** and posts about community involvement (SickKids Foundation, DIVERSEcity), indicating he values relationships and corporate citizenship alongside technical excellence.

His documented technology accomplishments center on **Oracle ERP**. He led Sleeman's migration from Oracle 11.5.8 to R12 and championed document automation for purchase orders and sales acknowledgments. His public quote about vendor selection—*"Being so strong [on Oracle integration], we didn't evaluate any other competitors"*—reveals a pragmatic approach: he values proven solutions that integrate cleanly with existing infrastructure over bleeding-edge technology requiring extensive customization.

## Sleeman's tech stack creates data accessibility challenges

Sleeman operates a sophisticated but fragmented technology environment across **four breweries** (Guelph, Vernon, Chambly, Calgary) and **11 distribution centers**:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Process Control | Rockwell PlantPAx DCS | Brewing automation, recipe management |
| Manufacturing | FactoryTalk Brew (Actemium) | Brewing-specific software, historian |
| ERP | Oracle E-Business Suite R12 | Core enterprise operations |
| Development | Oracle Apex | Custom applications |
| HR | Workday | Recruitment, HR management |
| Service Desk | Freshservice | IT service management |
| Infrastructure | VMware | Server virtualization |

The **Rockwell PlantPAx implementation** was transformational—increasing Vernon brewery production **50% within two weeks** (8 to 12 brews/day) and achieving industry-leading 2-hour brew cycles. Yet this success creates a data paradox: production systems generate rich real-time data (pressure, temperature, flow rates, batch reports), but that data likely remains siloed from Oracle ERP financial data, sales information, and supply chain systems.

Sleeman's documented challenges before automation—paper-based batch reporting, manual temperature monitoring, operator-dependent processes—suggest the organization has made significant OT progress but may still struggle with **IT/OT data integration**. The company explicitly stated future plans to expand PlantPAx standardization "across all facilities for corporate-level visibility," signaling ongoing gaps in enterprise-wide data access.

## Seven pain points a Text-to-SQL platform directly addresses

Based on industry research and Sleeman's specific context, Brian likely faces these challenges daily:

**Data silos prevent business insights.** Brewing production data (PlantPAx historian), financial data (Oracle ERP), sales data (likely Oracle or separate CRM), and supply chain data exist in disconnected systems. Business users asking "What was our production cost per hectoliter last quarter by brand and facility?" probably require IT intervention or cobbled-together Excel analyses.

**Self-service analytics demand is outpacing IT capacity.** With only 36 IT staff supporting 1,100 employees across 15 locations, every ad-hoc report request creates backlog. Business users want answers immediately; Brian's team becomes a bottleneck rather than an enabler.

**Parent company visibility is critical.** Sapporo acquired Sleeman for $400 million in 2006 and expects clear performance reporting. Brian must demonstrate operational excellence to Japanese leadership accustomed to rigorous standards. Natural language querying in English could accelerate executive reporting dramatically.

**Compliance documentation is burdensome.** Breweries face dual regulation—TTB (alcohol) and FDA (food safety/FSMA)—requiring detailed traceability records, hazard analysis documentation, and batch tracking. Automated querying of compliance data would reduce manual documentation effort.

**Multi-location complexity creates blind spots.** Comparing production efficiency, quality metrics, or inventory across four brewing facilities requires consolidating data from multiple systems. Without unified access, local optimization occurs at the expense of enterprise optimization.

**Legacy Oracle expertise is scarce and expensive.** Oracle EBS R12 specialists are increasingly rare; market dynamics favor companies with newer cloud ERP systems. Any solution reducing dependency on specialized Oracle query skills has immediate value.

**The PMO needs better project data.** Brian's PMO responsibilities include tracking portfolio KPIs, resource allocation, and ROI across technology investments. If project data lives in spreadsheets or disconnected tools, demonstrating IT's business value becomes difficult.

## What motivates Brian professionally

Research on IT Director career advancement reveals clear patterns that likely apply to Brian:

**Demonstrating business value, not just technical competence.** Gartner research shows CIOs who effectively communicate IT's business value secure **60% higher funding** than peers focused on technology metrics. Brian has a 36-person department to justify; connecting IT initiatives to revenue improvement, cost reduction, and risk mitigation matters enormously.

**Credibility with Sapporo headquarters.** Subsidiary IT leaders build reputation through "initiative-taking beyond mandated activities." Brian can differentiate himself by proposing innovations (like AI-powered analytics) that could scale across Sapporo's global operations—positioning Sleeman as an innovation leader rather than just a compliant subsidiary.

**The path from Director to VP/CIO.** Brian holds a Director title with broad responsibility—a common stepping stone to VP IT or CIO roles. Championing transformational technologies that deliver measurable business outcomes creates the "value stories" essential for career advancement.

**PMO governance excellence.** PMI research shows 80% of high-performing organizations have well-defined governance frameworks. Demonstrating that Sleeman's PMO delivers projects on time, on budget, with clear ROI tracking strengthens Brian's reputation as a disciplined leader.

**Industry recognition potential.** Programs like CIO 100 Awards, ORBIE Awards, and CIO Hall of Fame recognize IT leaders who drive innovation. An AI analytics initiative with documented business impact could position Brian for such recognition.

## Making the demo personally compelling to Brian

To resonate with Brian's specific situation, a Text-to-SQL demo should emphasize:

**Oracle integration proof points.** Brian explicitly valued Oracle integration strength in past vendor decisions. Demonstrating seamless connectivity to Oracle EBS R12—querying financial, supply chain, and operational data—removes his biggest adoption objection. Show how natural language questions translate to Oracle SQL without requiring his team to build custom reports.

**Business user empowerment.** Frame the solution as enabling sales managers, production supervisors, and finance analysts to answer their own questions instantly. This repositions IT from bottleneck to enabler and frees Brian's team for strategic work rather than ad-hoc reporting.

**Multi-source data federation.** If the platform can query across Oracle ERP, Rockwell historian data, and other sources simultaneously, demonstrate this explicitly. The ability to ask "Show me production yield, cost per hectoliter, and margin by brand for Q3" across previously siloed systems directly addresses Sleeman's architecture challenges.

**Governance and auditability.** As PMO leader and compliance-conscious IT director, Brian will care about query logging, access controls, data governance, and audit trails. Show how the platform maintains security while democratizing access—he cannot compromise on governance to gain agility.

**Sapporo reporting scenario.** Include a use case specifically about generating executive dashboards or reports for parent company stakeholders. Help Brian visualize presenting to Sapporo leadership with AI-generated insights that make him look like a strategic asset, not a cost center.

**Implementation pragmatism.** Brian values proven solutions that work within existing infrastructure. Avoid positioning as "rip and replace"—show how the platform augments current investments (Oracle, PlantPAx) rather than requiring disruptive change. Reference quick time-to-value and phased deployment options.

**ROI framework for PMO.** Provide clear metrics Brian can use to justify the investment: reduction in ad-hoc report requests, time saved per query, faster decision cycles, compliance documentation efficiency. These map directly to PMO success metrics he already tracks.

## The visionary leadership opportunity

Brian can position Text-to-SQL AI adoption as **transformational leadership**, not just tool procurement. The narrative writes itself: "We enabled every business user to access enterprise data in natural language, accelerating decisions from days to seconds while maintaining governance." This story works for Sapporo executives, industry recognition programs, and future career advancement.

Research shows 76% of manufacturing executives cite AI as important to advancing objectives. By championing AI-powered data access, Brian moves from "keeping the lights on" IT management to strategic transformation leadership. For someone who has methodically built credentials (Western degree, USF BPM certificate, PMP certification) and progressed from systems manager to IT Director/PMO, this represents the next logical career milestone—becoming the leader who brought AI to Sleeman.

The key is framing the demo not as "here's a cool technology" but as "here's how you become the executive who solved data accessibility for a 170-year-old brewery while protecting the governance and compliance your Japanese parent company demands." That's the pitch that resonates with Brian Cappellaro's professional motivations, career trajectory, and organizational context.
