# Presentation Narrative & Talking Points
## Sleeman Breweries Demo for Brian Cappellaro

---

## THE STORY ARC

**Theme**: *A trusted guide helps a capable leader solve a complex problem and become invaluable to his organization.*

**Your Role**: You are not a salesperson. You are a peer—a fellow technologist who has seen this transformation work at other enterprises and is offering Brian a path forward.

**Brian's Role**: He is the protagonist. The hero who will solve data accessibility for Sleeman. You're just showing him the tools.

---

## PRE-MEETING MINDSET

Before you walk in, remember:

1. **Brian has 30+ years of experience.** He's seen vendors come and go. He can smell a pitch from a mile away. Don't pitch—consult.

2. **He's not looking for technology.** He's looking for a way to demonstrate value to Sapporo, reduce his team's burden, and position himself as a strategic leader.

3. **His IT team of 36 serves 4 breweries and 11 distribution centers.** They're stretched thin. Every ad-hoc report request is a tax on his people.

4. **Sapporo is always watching.** Tokyo wants visibility, governance, and proof that their Canadian investment is well-managed.

## SLIDE-BY-SLIDE NARRATIVE

---

### SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Time**: 30 seconds

**What to say**:
> "Brian, thank you for making time today. Before we dive in, I want to be clear about what this isn't—this isn't a product demo. This is a conversation about a problem I think you're uniquely positioned to solve at Sleeman."

**Thought seed**: *Set the tone that this is a strategic conversation, not a sales pitch.*

---

### SLIDE 2: Who We Are
**Time**: 60-90 seconds

**What to say**:
> "Quick context on Innovoco—we've been doing this for over a decade. You'll recognize some names here: Labatt, Pernod Ricard, Steam Whistle. We understand beverage manufacturing."
>
> *[Gesture to credentials sidebar]*
>
> "What I'm most proud of is that 10-year number at the bottom—our longest client relationship. We don't do drive-by implementations. We build partnerships."

**Thought seed**: *You're not just another vendor. You understand his world.*

**What NOT to do**: Don't read every logo. Don't brag. Let the visual speak.

---

### SLIDE 3: What We Do in the AI Practice
**Time**: 2-3 minutes

**What to say**:
> "I want to walk you through what we've built in our AI practice—not to show off, but because each of these maps to a challenge I suspect you're dealing with."
>
> *[Point to Knowledge Graphs]*
> "This one—'One query across every system'—this is about connecting Oracle, PlantPAx, Workday, and everything else into a single layer. So someone can ask a question without knowing which system holds the answer."
>
> *[Point to AI Governance]*
> "And this one matters for you specifically—'Governance that satisfies Tokyo.' Every query logged. Every access controlled. Full audit trail."

**Thought seeds to plant**:
- "What if your team didn't have to be the bottleneck for every data request?"
- "What if Sapporo could get visibility without you having to build custom reports?"

**Pause and ask**:
> "Which of these resonates most with what you're dealing with today?"

*Let Brian talk. Listen. This tells you what to emphasize in the demo.*

---

### SLIDE 4: AI In Brewing
**Time**: 2 minutes

**What to say**:
> "You're not alone in thinking about this. AB InBev, Heineken, Molson Coors—they're all investing heavily in AI for operations."
>
> *[Point to McKinsey stat]*
> "78% of enterprises are now using AI in some form. That number was 55% two years ago. The adoption curve is steep."
>
> *[Pause on the bold statement]*
> "But here's what I've observed—every legacy brewery has data. Decades of it. The difference is whether there's a leader who knows how to unlock it."

**Thought seed**: *Brian is that leader. Don't say it. Let him think it.*

**What NOT to say**: Anything that sounds like "you're behind" or "competitors are beating you." No fear. Only opportunity.

---

### SLIDE 5: Value Case
**Time**: 90 seconds

**What to say**:
> "I want to share some benchmarks—not promises, but verified results from implementations we've studied."
>
> *[Point to each metric briefly]*
> "60% throughput improvement—that's AB InBev's filtration optimization with Google Cloud. 20-50% downtime reduction—that's McKinsey's manufacturing research. These are the kinds of outcomes we design toward."
>
> "I'm not going to promise you these exact numbers. What I will say is that we'll define success metrics together—metrics your PMO already tracks—and build toward them."

**Thought seed**: *We're rigorous. We cite sources. We don't make empty promises.*

---

### SLIDE 6: Meet Barley
**Time**: 60 seconds (then transition to live demo)

**What to say**:
> "So let me introduce you to Barley."
>
> *[Read the headline]*
> "'Get your data quicker than sending an email.' That's the bar we're setting."
>
> "Your production manager has a question at 7am. Instead of emailing IT and waiting two days, they type it in plain English and get an answer in seconds. With a full audit trail."
>
> "Let me show you what I mean."

**Transition**: Click "See Demo" or switch to the live BrewMind application.

---

### LIVE DEMO
**Time**: 10-15 minutes

**Demo flow**:
1. Start with a simple question Brian would care about
   - "What was our production volume by facility last month?"

2. Show the thinking process (if Quick mode, show speed; if Pro mode, show depth)

3. Ask Brian what he'd want to know
   - "What question would you ask if you had all your data at your fingertips?"
   - *Type his actual question. This is the magic moment.*

4. Show governance/audit capability
   - "Every query is logged. Here's the SQL that was generated. Here's who asked it and when."

**Key talking points during demo**:
- "Notice this didn't require anyone to know SQL."
- "This would have been a 2-day turnaround from your team. Now it's 8 seconds."
- "Imagine if every business user could do this—how many tickets does that take off your team?"

### SLIDE 7: How It Works
**Time**: 2-3 minutes

**What to say**:
> "Let me show you what's under the hood—because I know you'll want to understand how this integrates with what you already have."
>
> *[Walk through the architecture]*
> "At the top, we connect to your existing systems—Oracle EBS R12, PlantPAx historian, Workday. We don't replace anything. We sit alongside."
>
> "The AI orchestration layer is where the magic happens—multiple specialized agents working together to understand the question, find the data, and generate the answer."
>
> "But this layer—governance and audit—this is what makes it enterprise-ready. Every query logged. Access controls that respect your existing permissions. This is what lets you sleep at night. This is what satisfies Tokyo."
>
> *[Point to the callout box]*
> "Our philosophy: You architect the transformation. We build the engine."

**Thought seed**: *You're in control. We're the experts who make your vision real.*

---

### SLIDE 8: Investment Options
**Time**: 2 minutes

**What to say**:
> "Let me walk you through how we typically engage."
>
> *[Point to Fractional AI Team]*
> "For organizations building long-term AI capability, we offer a fractional AI team. Dedicated engineers, monthly strategy sessions, ongoing support. Think of it as extending your team with specialized AI expertise."
>
> *[Point to Project-Based]*
> "If you want to start with something specific—like the data analyst agent we just demoed—we can do a defined-scope project. POC to production in 12-16 weeks."
>
> "Both models include full governance documentation and PMO reporting. I know that matters for how you run projects."

**Pause and ask**:
> "Based on what you've seen, which model feels like a better fit for how Sleeman operates?"

*Let Brian guide the conversation. His answer tells you how to position the close.*

---

### SLIDE 9: Next Steps
**Time**: 90 seconds

**What to say**:
> "If this makes sense to explore further, here's what the path looks like."
>
> *[Walk through timeline]*
> "We'll have a detailed scope of work to you within 48 hours. Once approved, we schedule a kickoff. You provide credentials, we identify stakeholders, and within two weeks the project begins."
>
> "It's designed to be straightforward. No six-month procurement cycles."

**Thought seed**: *This is achievable. The path is clear.*

---

### SLIDE 10: Availability
**Time**: 60 seconds

**What to say**:
> "One thing I should mention—we're intentional about how many new engagements we take on. One per month, to ensure we can deliver the quality and attention each client deserves."
>
> *[Point to calendar]*
> "January is available. February is in discussions with another organization. If this aligns with your priorities, I'd recommend we move to scope quickly."

**What NOT to say**: Anything that sounds like pressure or artificial scarcity. State it factually and let Brian decide.

**Close**:
> "Brian, what questions do you have? What would you need to see to move this forward?"

---

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "We need to involve procurement / this needs to go through a process"
> "Absolutely. What would be helpful for that process? We can provide reference calls, security documentation, whatever you need. In the meantime, should we draft a scope so you have something concrete to socialize internally?"

### "The timing isn't right / we have other priorities"
> "I understand. What's driving your priorities right now? Is there a way this could support what you're already working on—or reduce burden elsewhere so your team has capacity?"

### "We've tried AI before and it didn't work"
> "Tell me more about that. What happened?" *[Listen carefully]* "That's exactly why we focus on governance and integration from day one. We're not building science projects—we're building production systems."

### "I need to talk to my team / Sapporo"
> "Of course. What information would help you have that conversation? I can put together a one-pager, or we could schedule a follow-up that includes whoever needs to be in the room."

---
